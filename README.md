# Advanced Programming Class Exercise - Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains the solution codes for the class exercises of the **Advanced Programming** course. The solutions are implemented in **C#** and are structured in a way that students can easily find and review them after completing them.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to an assignment. Inside each folder, you will find:

-   **Solution Files (`.cs`)**: These files contain the correct implementation for each problem in the assignment.
-   **Documentation (`CE*`)**: Additional explanations or notes related to the assignment.

### Folder & File Structure:

```
/ (Root)
â”‚â”€â”€ 1/  (Class Exercises 1)
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 1.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ CE1 (Documentation)
â”‚â”€â”€ 2/  (Class Exercises 2)
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 1.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 2.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ CE2 (Documentation)
â”‚â”€â”€ 3/
â”‚â”€â”€ 4/
â”‚â”€â”€ 5/
â”‚â”€â”€ 6/
â”‚â”€â”€ 7/
```

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to the Class Exercise Folder**: Find the relevant class exercise folder (e.g., `1/` for Class Exercise 1).
2. **Open the Solution Files**: Each problem solution is numbered accordingly (`1.cs`, `2.cs`, etc.).
3. **Review Documentation**: The `HW*` file provides additional details about the class exercise.
4. **Learn from the Solutions**: Compare with your own implementation and understand the correct approach.

## Notes

-   These solutions are provided for **learning purposes only**. Students are encouraged to attempt the class exercises before reviewing the solutions.
-   If you have any questions, feel free to discuss them in the course forums or with the Teaching Assistants.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
